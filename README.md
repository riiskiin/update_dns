# update_dns
Update IP
This tool is intended to be used under the API from namecheap in order to update the DNS records for every domain.
I'm using pyhon because of the friendly API request that is included in the request module.

It's easy to use and you do not need to install it, you can only run from desktop, but you have to download Python, if you want you can compile it. 

Further i will compile it to read a JSON file from where Domain information could be pulled out and the compiled app could reference to in order to have a fully compiled (portable) app that can be used any time.
